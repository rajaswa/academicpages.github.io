<p padding="10px"><img align="right" src="../images/cte_talk.jpg" alt="research talk" style="zoom:25%;" /></p>My research interests focus on bridging the gap between biological and computational models of natural language processing. This involves inspecting biological plausibility of the existing language models for various tasks, behavioural modelling of language learning & understanding and building robust computational models of language.

I am currently actively following these topics:

* *Adversarial Learning in Natural Language Processing*
* *Bias in NLP models*
* *Automatic Scoring of Text and Speech Quality*
* *Multimodality in Language Learning*
* *Neural Discourse Models* 

&nbsp;

Currently, I am pursuing my Bachelor's Thesis at [IIIT Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/) under the guidance of Prof. [Rajiv Ratn Shah](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/rajivratn) on the topic: *Speech Processing*. I am actively seeking collaborations and research interns for currently active projects on *Computational Psycholinguistics* and *Neurolinguistics*.
