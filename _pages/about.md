I am an engineering undergrad at [BITS Pilani Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/) and am pursuing a major in Electrical & Electronics. I am currently working on some of the [SemEval 2020](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2020/index.php?id=tasks) tasks,  working on transformer-based semantic search frameworks, working on Gender Bias in Indian low-resources languages, working on a Psycholinguistics project at the [Cognitive Neuroscience Lab, BITS Goa](http://bitscogneuro.com/) and am actively looking for an Academic mentorship / Thesis / RA opportunity in Computational Linguistics, Cognitive Neuroscience and related fields.

My primary research areas of interest include Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Cognitive Science & Psycholinguistics. I am extensively exploring the domains of Natural Language Understanding, Information Retrieval, AI for Networked Social Systems, Graph based approaches for Natural Language Processing, Heuristic approaches for Language Learning tasks & Structured Data Mining.

I am also an active Competitive Data Scientist and am currently a Competitions Expert at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rajaswa).

Apart from the above mentioned technical interests, I also share a keen interest towards Social Sciences, Ecocriticism, Electronic Music & Table Tennis.
