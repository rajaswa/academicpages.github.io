I am an engineering undergrad at **[BITS Pilani Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/)** and am pursuing a major in *Electrical & Electronics engineering*. My primary research areas of interest include *Natural Language Processing*, *Machine Learning*, *Cognitive Neuroscience* & *Psycholinguistics*. I am extensively exploring the domains of **Natural Language Understanding**, **Information Retrieval**, **Discourse**, **Causal Reasoning** & **Language Acquisition**.



Currently, I am working as a **Research Intern** at **[MIDAS-IIITD](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/)** and working on a funded **Psycholinguistics project** at the **[Cognitive Neuroscience Lab at BITS Goa](http://bitscogneuro.com)**.

I also play around with competitive Data Science and am currently a Competitions Expert at **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rajaswa).**

Apart from the above mentioned technical interests, I also share a keen interest towards Social Sciences, Eco-criticism, Electronic Music & Table Tennis.
