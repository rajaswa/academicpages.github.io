I am an engineering undergrad at BITS Pilani Goa Campus and am pursuing a major in Electrical & Electronics. I am currently working on some of the [SemEval 2020](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2020/index.php?id=tasks) tasks and am looking for an Academic mentorship / Thesis / RA opportunity in Computational Linguistics, Cognitive Neuroscience and related fields for the same.

My primary research areas of interest include Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Cognitive Science & Psycholinguistics. I am extensively exploring the domains of Natural Language Understanding, Information Retrieval, AI for Networked Social Systems, Graph based approaches for Natural Language Processing, Heuristic approaches for Language Learning tasks & Structured Data Mining.

I am also an active Competitive Data Scientist and am currently a Competitions Expert at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rajaswa).

Apart from the above mentioned technical interests, I also share a keen interest towards Social Sciences, Ecocriticism & Electronic Music.
